# dynamic-programming-solutions

Those who cannot remember their past are condemned to repeat it.

Dynamic programming is a way of breaking problems up into repeated subproblems, 
then solving the sub-problems from the bottom up, 
reusing any answers that youâ€™ve already figured out.

-OptimalSubstructure =>optimal solution for sub-problems optimal(min,max,largest,smallest)
-Overlapping sub-problems => sub-problem that occurs multiple time.
(merge sort => divide n conquer)

approaches:
    1 -Top-down (Memoization) => can be recursive
    2 -Bottom-up (Tabulation) => Iterative
Recursion:

Base cases:

Memoization:

Tabulation:
